# Overview
---

The primary purposes of introducing Core LST are:

●	Improve user experience
●	Bring more utilities of CORE token

For the moment users can stake CORE tokens to individual validators directly through https://stake.coredao.org. However, there are two drawbacks raised by the community

●	There is no auto-compounding feature, and users need to claim rewards and restake them to validators manually everyday. 
●	The hash stakes from BTC mining pools are less fungible and not as stable as CORE stakes, which causes affected validators’ APR to change more dramatically.

On the other hand, we are also seeking ways to add more utilities to the CORE token itself. By introducing stCORE, we expect the CORE token itself to also benefit. E.g. to provide CORE/stCORE liquidity pairs in decentralized exchanges.
