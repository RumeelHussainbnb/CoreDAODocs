# Submitting Slash Suggestions
---

Verifiers are responsible for reporting malicious behaviors on the network through _slash suggestions_. Slash suggestions can be submitted by anyone, and are designed to punish malicious actors. The submission requires evidence of wrongdoing, but if the allegations prove true, the rewards earned greatly exceed the costs.

As with slash suggestions, verifiers are charged with reporting double signing, and also have to submit evidence of this activity. If their allegations are borne out, they are rewarded for keeping the network safe.
