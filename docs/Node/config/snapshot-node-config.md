# Snapshot Node Configuration
---
Snapshots are important for a network to ensure nodes are able to sync up to the latest state of the network as quickly as possible. Before nodes can be used, they must sync up to the current state of the network, by starting from a recent snapshot these nodes can fast-track a majority of the syncing.

## Types of Snapshots
There are two ways through which snappshot nodes can help other node operators sync up with the network:
1. State Sync
2. Snapshots

## System Requirements

There are several system requirements, both software and hardware, for setting up a snapshot node on the Core network.

### Software

* Currently, a Core Snapshot Node can only run on **Mac OS X** or on the **Linux** operating systems.

### Hardware

Core nodes perform several resource-intensive tasks, which can include storing blockchain data, verifying blocks or transactions, communicating with peer nodes, and answering network requests, depending on their configuration. Each type of Core node has specific hardware requirements based on their expected needs.
