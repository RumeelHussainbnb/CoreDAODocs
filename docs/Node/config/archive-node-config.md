# Archieve Node Configuration
---

Archive nodes in the Core network play a crucial role in maintaining the complete historical state of the network. These nodes are specialized versions of full nodes with enhanced capabilities tailored to storing and providing access to the entire history of all transactions and states since the inception of the Core Chain.  

## System Requirements

There are several system requirements, both software and hardware, for setting up a Archieve node on the Core network.

### Software

* Currently, a Core archieve node can only run on **Mac OS X** or on the **Linux** operating systems.

### Hardware

Core nodes perform several resource-intensive tasks, which can include storing blockchain data, verifying blocks or transactions, communicating with peer nodes, and answering network requests, depending on their configuration. Each type of Core node has specific hardware requirements based on their expected needs.
